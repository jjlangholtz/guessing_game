# Number Guessing Games
=======================
Included are two separate number guessing games. The first game allows the user
five guesses to pick a random number (1-100) chosen by the computer.

The second game is reversed. The user selects a number from (1-100) and the
computer will attempt to pick the number, guided by user input.
